You should only delete a member if this is a duplicate account, was created accidentally, or is otherwise very insignificant. If this is a former member, we suggest you mark them as 'alumni' rather than deleting the account. You can mark members as 'alumni' in bulk in Chapter &gt; Manage members &gt; Edit member status
