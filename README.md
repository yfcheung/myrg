==========

myRobogals is the global intranet and record-keeping tool for Robogals. It has been built to simplify many of our day-to-day tasks including organising school visits, maintaining a member database, communicating with members, storing records reliably for future generations and easily collecting statistics on a global scale. https://my.robogals.org
